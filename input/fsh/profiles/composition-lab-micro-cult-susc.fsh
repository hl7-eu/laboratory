\r\nA composition is a set of healthcare-related information that is assembled together into a single logical document that provides a single coherent statement of meaning, establishes its own context and that has clinical attestation with regard to who is making the statement. \r\nWhile a Composition defines the structure, it does not actually contain the content: rather the full content of a document is contained in a Bundle, of which the Composition is the first resource contained.
\r\nThis profile includes the additional constraints for representing the microorganism identification and the links for the nested susceptibility tests and results."
