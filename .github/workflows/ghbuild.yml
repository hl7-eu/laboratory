# This is a simple workflow that runs the publisher and copies the output to https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/index.html
# Based on the idea by Carl Leitner
# Change log:
# 2021-06-18: (JCT): publish default branches to / , other branches branches/<branch>
# 2021-11-26: (JCT): Reusable workflow
# 2022-01-28: (JCT): add auto-create gh-pages if it doesn't exist
# 2023-01-22: (JCT): use checkout action v3, and JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
