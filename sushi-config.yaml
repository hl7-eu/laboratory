# The dependencies property corresponds to IG.dependsOn. The key is the
# package id and the value is the version (or dev/current). For advanced
# use cases, the value can be an object with keys for id, uri, and version.

#
# The pages property corresponds to IG.definition.page. SUSHI can
# auto-generate the page list, but if the author includes pages in
# this file, it is assumed that the author will fully manage the
# pages section and SUSHI will not generate any page entries.
# The page file name is used as the key. If title is not provided,
# then the title will be generated from the file name.  If a
# generation value is not provided, it will be inferred from the
# file name extension.  Any subproperties that are valid filenames
# with supported extensions (e.g., .md/.xml) will be treated as
# sub-pages.

#
#
# The global property corresponds to the IG.global property, but it
# uses the type as the YAML key and the profile as its value. Since
# FHIR does not explicitly disallow more than one profile per type,
# neither do we; the value can be a single profile URL or an array
# of profile URLs. If a value is an id or name, SUSHI will replace
# it with the correct canonical when generating the IG JSON.
#
# global:
#   Patient: http://example.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/my-patient-profile
#   Encounter: http://example.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/my-encounter-profile
#
#
# The resources property corresponds to IG.definition.resource.
# SUSHI can auto-generate all of the resource entries based on
# the FSH definitions and/or information in any user-provided
# JSON or XML resource files. If the generated entries are not
# sufficient or complete, however, the author can add entries
# here. If the reference matches a generated entry, it will
# replace the generated entry. If it doesn't match any generated
# entries, it will be added to the generated entries. The format
# follows IG.definition.resource with the following differences:
#   * use IG.definition.resource.reference.reference as the YAML key.
#   * if the key is an id or name, SUSHI will replace it with the
#     correct URL when generating the IG JSON.
#   * specify "omit" to omit a FSH-generated resource from the
#     resource list.
#   * if the exampleCanonical is an id or name, SUSHI will replace
#     it with the correct canonical when generating the IG JSON.
#   * groupingId can be used, but top-level groups syntax may be a
#     better option (see below).
# The following are simple examples to demonstrate what this might
# look like:

# Groups can control certain aspects of the IG generation.  The IG
# documentation recommends that authors use the default groups that
# are provided by the templating framework, but if authors want to
# use their own instead, they can use the mechanism below.  This will
# create IG.definition.grouping entries and associate the individual
# resource entries with the corresponding groupIds. If a resource
